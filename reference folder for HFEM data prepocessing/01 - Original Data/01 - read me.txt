In this folder, original compressed DICOMs are meant to be saved in "011" and then decompressed and saved in "012"
using the script "multiple_DICOM_uncompressing_and_reordering.py". They are also re-organized by their z position and numbered.

#Iam am also changing the file names depending on which series they belong to
